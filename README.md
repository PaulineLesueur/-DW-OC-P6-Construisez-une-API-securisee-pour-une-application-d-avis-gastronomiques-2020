This is the backend for an OpenClassrooms project, you can find the frontend here : https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/dwj-projet6

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine. You'll also need the .env file (not inclued in the repo for security purpose) if you want to connect with the database. I'll send it to you if you want.

### Installation ###

You need to put the .env file into the backend folder
If you want to run the project, you have to download the both repositories and put them into one folder. Then, you'll need to run `npm install -g @angular/cli`. 
Next, you go to the frontend folder and run `npm install` and `ng serve`. You should be able to see the application here : http://localhost:4200
